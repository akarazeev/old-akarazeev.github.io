To list al installed packages and save them to the file: `apm list --installed --bare > package-list.txt`

To install packages from the list: `apm install --packages-file package-list.txt`

`pip install --upgrade pycodestyle`
`pip install --upgrade pyflakes`

My Theme: both `UI Theme` and `Syntax Theme` are “One Light”.

Spell-check: set `Locales` to “en-US, ru-RU”.
