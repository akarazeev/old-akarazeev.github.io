Hi, my name is Anton.

I'm a student of [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](https://mipt.ru/english/), [Department of Innovation and High Technologies](https://mipt.ru/diht/). My major courses are computer science, machine learning and physics.

Also I'm a researcher at [Russian Quantum Center](http://www.rqc.ru/) and founder of [MIPT SciTech Club](https://www.facebook.com/scitechmipt/) :blush:.

I like creating things with my hands, #DIY. Besides that I like photography. When I travel to mountains or foreign countries I shoot videos and edit them, make timelapses, etc. Most of my videos can be found on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/AntonKarazeev) and photographs on my Instagram profiles: [@akarazeev](https://www.instagram.com/akarazeev/) and [@somevhere](https://www.instagram.com/somevhere/). Also I have [channel](https://t.me/akarazeevchannel) on Telegram platform where I write in Russian language.
