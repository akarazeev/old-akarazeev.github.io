["Improving the Realism of Synthetic Images"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07828.pdf) - _Anton Karazeev_ about paper by Apple ([Machine Learning Journal](https://machinelearning.apple.com/2017/07/07/GAN.html))

The key novelty here is using the generator's history to improve discriminator (and performance of the proposed refiner model)

Thanks to _Valentin Malykh_ for help in understanding the paper
