_Danil Lykov_ about Hinton's paper on ["Dynamic Routing Between Capsules"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829)

New method of information transmitting from different areas of image is proposed (in convolutional networks the Pooling-layer is responsible for that).

Proposed method allows to recognize overlapped objects more effectively and better process ambiguous images.

Moreover the authors of this paper use interesting method of regularization - divergence of recovered vector from low dimensional space between the original one.
