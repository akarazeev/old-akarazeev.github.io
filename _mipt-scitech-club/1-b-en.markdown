_Daria Romanovskaia_ about Nature paper "Predicting the sequence specificities of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins by deep learning" (https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3300)

Authors of this paper proposed new method based on Deep Learning (DL) to predict binding sites of RNA- and DNA-binding proteins that are regulators of gene expression.

Method is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that help to assign affinity score to every sequence.

As a result - proposed method is very accurate and it works much better than already existent programs for searching of biological motifs in DNA and RNA. A useful add-on is the visualization of maps of potentially pathogenic mutations.
