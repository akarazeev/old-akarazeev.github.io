"Improving the Realism of Synthetic Images" - _Anton Karazeev_ about paper by Apple (Machine Learning Journal: https://machinelearning.apple.com/2017/07/07/GAN.html, full paper's text: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07828.pdf)

The key novelty here is using the generator's history to improve discriminator (and performance of the proposed refiner model)

Thanks to _Valentin Malykh_ for help in understanding the paper
