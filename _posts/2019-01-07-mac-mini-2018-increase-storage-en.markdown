In this video I show how to increase the disk space of my Mac mini 2018 (actually the same method works for any Mac) by using external SSD by WD

When I was buying my Mac mini, I decided to spent more money on the processor and chose 3.2 GHz 6-core Intel Core i7. But I hadn‚Äôt enough money to chose larger than 128GB internal storage

This SSD has Type-C cable and Type-C to Type-A adapter. Also the size is pretty small so it was easy to mount the SSD behind my Mac mini

As an external SSD I use [MyPassport by WD](https://www.wd.com/products/portable-storage/my-passport-ssd.html#WDBKVX2560PSL-WESN)
